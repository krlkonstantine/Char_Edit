Hi there!

Tis is a SPA build on Next.js using redux-toolkit as state manager. This app allows users to create and edit their characters for an abstract RPG game. The character with specific parameters can be both imported or exported for future use. 

There are also two languages and tooltips for each property. 

!For cheaters only:
If you've got tired of everything and you want no limits in this life, here's a bonus specially for you! It will change everything!!! 
Make your character and export it on your device. Open the .json file in a text editor and find the property "points". 
Instead of that small number type in the quantity of points you want..
you're welcome ;D
